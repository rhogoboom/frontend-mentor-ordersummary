## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow (sort of?)
- Bootstrap


### What I learned

Through this project, I was able to continue developing my understanding of CSS and Bootstrap. I think having an idea of the finished product in front of me is incredibly important for how I lay things out. I look forward to continuing these challenges and further grasping fundamental HTML and CSS. 


### Continued development

While I did learn more through this project, I hope to continue learning by doing.
